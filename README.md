# Grading-Calulator
A Qt Widget Application that allows the user to calculate their grade in PIC 10B or PIC 10C

The user is allowed to select a course, use the slide bars and spin boxes to choose their scores in each of the 8 homeworks and on the 2 midterms and final. The user can then select Grading Schema A in which Homeworks are worth 25% of the overall score, each Midterm is worth 20% and the Final is worth 35%, or Grading Schema B in which Homeworks are worth 25% of the overall score, the higher score of the two midterms is worth 30% and the Final is worth 45% of the overall score. In each Schema, the lowest homework score is dropped, meaning only 7 Homeworks contribute to the overall score.
